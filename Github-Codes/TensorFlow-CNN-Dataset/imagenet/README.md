# AlexNet training on ImageNet LSVRC 2012

![alt text](tsne-full.jpg)

This repository contains an implementation of AlexNet convolutional neural network and its training and testing procedures on the ILSVRC 2012 dataset, all using TensorFlow. 

Folder ```tf``` contains code in the "classic TensorFlow" framework whereas code in the ```tf_eager``` directory has been developed with TensorFlow's new impearative style, TensorFlow eager.

The two implementations are independent and refer to the READMEs inside the folders for specific instruction on how to train and to test.
